### ðŸ§± 4 Primitives of OpenAI Agents SDK
Primitives are the building blocks of Agents SDK:

1. Agent â€“ Have main AI brain and tools.
3. Handoff â€“ Pass task from one agent to another.
3. Guardrails â€“ Safety rules and policies.
4. Session â€“ Memory of a conversation.

### ðŸ§¾ 3 Types of OpenAI API
1. Chat Completion â€“ Stateless, no memory between messages.
2. Responses â€“ Stateful, remembers conversation.
3. Assistant â€“ (More advanced, used for long-term memory & tools)

> # 004-model-settings:
- Temperature = How creative vs. focused your agent is
- Tool Choice = Whether your agent can use calculators, weather apps, etc.
- Max Tokens = How long the response can be
- Parallel Tools = Whether your agent can use multiple tools at once

> # 005-local-context:
Local context is any data or dependencies you pass to your agent's run that your code (tools, lifecycle hooks, etc.) can use. Itâ€™s entirely internal and never sent to the LLM.
- **Creating Context:** You create a Python objectâ€”often using a dataclass or a Pydantic modelâ€”to encapsulate data like a username, user ID, logger, or helper functions.

- **Passing Context:** You pass this object to the run method (e.g., Runner.run(..., context=your_context)). The SDK wraps your object in a RunContextWrapper, making it available to every tool function, lifecycle hook, or callback during that run via wrapper.context.
